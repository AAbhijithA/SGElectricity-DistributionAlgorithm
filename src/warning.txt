Please note that the example I given is just for a 5 giving and 5 receiving houses
for larger n1 and n2 values
if your visualization is not very good please use the following:
you can vary the size of the nodes as follows
nx.draw(...,node_size=x,...)
where x is any value you wish the node to be
'The default size of a node is x = 300'
